# Planning

The project is a little planning ICS viewer made in Javascript, HTML, CSS and a bit of PHP.

# Installation

## Prerequisite.

Planning needs `php` to bypass CORS when retreiving the ICS file. So you need to have a server running `php`.

## Download.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ThibSrb/Planning.git
```

## Configuration.

Put the Planning folder at a place accessible from the php server.

## Usage.
